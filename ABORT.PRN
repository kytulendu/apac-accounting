      *    being executed.

      *    The system determines this without the program being 
      *    interrupted.

      *    If a key has been pressed, the system will then read this data
      *    from the buffer and set WS-OPTION to 'Y' if the key that was 
      *    pressed, was the Escape key.
      *
      *    Any other key will result in the character being discarded and
      *    WS-OPTION will be set to 'N'.
